# React Tutorial

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project follows the [Tic Tac Toe Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Installation

### Setup

1. Create an empty GitHub repository first (ex. ktmeaton/react-tutorial).
1. Open with Gitpod (comes with node.js ).
1. Create an app within the GitHub repository (app will share name).

   ```
   npx create-react-app .
   ```

   This creates the following directories:  

       * node_modules
       * public
       * src

    This creates the following files:  
       * package.json
       * README.md
       * yarn.lock 

1. Test that react basic installation worked:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   This opens a browser preview on port:3000.

1. Remove all of the demo content in src:

   ```
   rm -f src/*
   ```

1. Create new CSS and Javascript content for your app.

   ```
   touch src/index.css
   touch src/index.js
   ```
